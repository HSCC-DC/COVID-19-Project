# D.C. Unemployment Portal Project

## Phase One - Instructions
* Develop Wireframe for your application (Use any wireframing tool of your choice).

### Phase Two - Frontend Design
#### Develop the frontend prototype for the following pages:
* Homepage (Applicant Login)
* Applicant Registration Page
* File Unemployment Form Page

### Phase Three - Develop Backend Functionality 
* Complete login functionality - An applicant should be able to login from the homepage using the most secure credential your team decides to use.
* Modify your site's design by creating a logo, updated footer, and navigation bar with important nav items (i.e. Inbox, File a claim, etc.)
* Complete registration functionality - An applicant should be able to register using with their:
  * Social Security Number
  * First Name
  * Last Name
  * E-mail
  * Username
  * Date of Birth
  * Address
  * City
  * State ID (This value can be pulled from the states table)
  * Zip Code
  * Gender
###### Important: The social security number needs to be validated. Remember, a D.C. SSN first three digits is within the range 577-579. All fields are required so remember to include blank field validations. The password must contain at least one uppercase letter, one digit, and have a maximum of 15 characters.
